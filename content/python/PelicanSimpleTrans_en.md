I have changed the translate engine of this blog that is made with Pelican. This is the Year of "Reinvent the Wheel", so I redone it from scratch. ^_^

You can find it here:

[https://github.com/gbinside/pelican_simpletranslate](https://github.com/gbinside/pelican_simpletranslate)

Keep an eye on the final folder structure. It must be as follow:

![path]({filename}/images/simpletrans.png)
